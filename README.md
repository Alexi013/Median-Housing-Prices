# Median-Housing-Prices
Data Vis Final
I have attached the data I converted into a CSV file in order to run my code on Jupyter, as well as I included the actual jupyter notebook in here as well!
This is the link to the website, https://www.car.org/en/marketdata/data/housingdata
I clicked on the "Median Prices of Existing Single Family Homes".
Thank you!
